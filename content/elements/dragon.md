  Dragon element is quite a bit different from other elements. It's the only
  element in the game that is usually weak to itself. 


  Frequently, it is also weak to Thunder and Ice. Taking Dragon damage can cause
  Dragonblight, which lowers weapon Affinity, completely removes a Weapon's
  Elemental Damage, and lowers the Status buildup of Poison, Paralysis, Sleep,
  and Blast attacks.
